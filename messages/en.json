        "History": "In 2013, we had the idea to create the BEST Training Week project. This event helped Lviv Polytechnic students gain new knowledge without any restrictions through short trainings. The organisers of the first such event were Uliana Bilonizhka, Olena Tomchuk, and Oksana Kaminetska. Thanks to the team's well-coordinated work and the desire to make the days of future generations more eventful and exciting, the idea was implemented. The first project gathered a lot of interested people and confirmed that the need for this is really great. Eleven such events have now been held, where students can receive quality information for free. This project has already become an integral part of the student environment, helping young people to quickly learn and find new opportunities for their growth and development.",
